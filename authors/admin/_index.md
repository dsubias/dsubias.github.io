I'm first-year PhD candidate in Computer Graphics at Graphics and Imaging Lab (University of Zaragoza, Spain), under the supervision of Prof. [Ana Serrano](https://ana-serrano.github.io/) and Prof. [Diego Guti√©rrez](http://giga.cps.unizar.es/~diegog/). My research topics are visual appearance, material perception and deep learning, but I'm open to explore other related research fields such as computer vision.
